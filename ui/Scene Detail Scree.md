## Scene Detail Screen — No Takes Yet

← Scene Review
SCRIPT
I handle deliveries, assemble furniture…

[ 🎥 Record First Take ]

Rules:
- No “No Takes Yet” card
- Show **one clear action**
- Script stays visible for confidence

---


## 4. Scene Detail Screen — With Takes

### Preferred Take Emphasis

SCRIPT
I've been at this for three years…

PREFERRED TAKE
[ thumbnail ] Take 1 • 7s 👍

OTHER TAKES
(only shown if >1)

Rules:
- Always show **preferred take first**
- Thumb icon is good — keep it
- Other takes collapsed by default


## 6. Navigation Consistency

- Scene list → Scene detail → Camera
- Back always returns **one level up**
- No modal dead-ends


## 7. Copy Fixes (Small but Important)

Replace:
- “ReTake” → **“Retake”**
- “No Takes Yet” → remove entirely
- “Record your first take” → **“Record First Take”**

Short, action-oriented copy only.
