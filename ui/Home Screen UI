1. Record scene-by-scene to avoid full re-records.
2. Short scenes make retakes faster and easier.
3. If a scene feels off, retake just that scene.
4. Pause naturally — silences are trimmed automatically.
5. Lock exposure to prevent brightness flicker.
6. Clean audio matters more than perfect video.
7. Most creators finish a video in under 10 minutes.
8. Structure reduces recording stress.
9. Progress beats perfection.
10. You’re in control — one scene at a time.
