# Script Draft Edit Screen

Minimal distraction-free editor for writing or pasting script content.

---

## Navigation Bar

```
← Back              Script Draft              Save
```

- **Back**: Returns to Project Details
- **Save**: Right-aligned, always visible

---

## Hint Banner
Small hint text below nav bar:

`Paste or write freely — we'll break this into scenes later.`

---

## Text Editor Area

Large, full-width text area with generous spacing

**Placeholder (when empty):**
```
Start typing or paste your script here…
You can write rough notes, full paragraphs,
or unstructured thoughts.
```

---

## Helper Actions (Sticky above keyboard)

```
[Clear draft]       
```

- Appear as subtle text button
- Sticky positioned above keyboard when editing

---

## Rules

### Save Button Behavior
- Always visible in nav bar
- **Disabled** until text changes (greyed out)
- First tap → Saves and shows `Saved`
- After first save → Auto-save silently on changes
- Optional toast: `Saved. You can refine this later.`

### Focus & Simplicity
- No secondary icons or actions in nav
- Focus is purely on writing
- Keyboard-first experience

### Readability
- Line height: `1.4–1.6`
- Slightly lighter font weight (regular, not bold)
- Generous horizontal padding (`16–20pt`)
- Clear paragraph spacing
- Large readable font size (`17–18pt`)
