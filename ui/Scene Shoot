### Scene Card — Recorded
Scene 3 10s
I've been at this for three years…

[ thumbnail ] Takes: 1 • Best: #1 • 7s
[ Retake ]
Rules:
- Thumbnail only when a take exists
- “Retake” appears **only if ≥1 take**
- Retake button smaller, secondary

### Visual Status (Very Important)
Add subtle status indicator:
- ● Not recorded
- ● Recorded
- ● In progress (optional)

## 2. Primary Action on List Screen

Add **sticky bottom CTA**:

### If current scene is unrecorded
[ Record Next Scene ]

### If all scenes recorded
[ Review & Export ]
This removes hesitation and decision fatigue.
